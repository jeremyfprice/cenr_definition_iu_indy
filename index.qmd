## Overview

Community-engaged research has emerged as a vital approach to scholarship that challenges traditional academic boundaries by fostering genuine partnerships between universities and communities and holds a critical position in Pillar 2 of the Indiana University system-wide and Indiana University Indianapolis 2030 Strategic Plan. However, the field has long struggled with inconsistent definitions and unclear evaluation criteria that have hindered its recognition and advancement within academic institutions.

The Community Engaged Research Faculty Circle (CERF-C) at Indiana University Indianapolis developed a comprehensive framework for community-engaged research (CEnR) through collaborative definition-building and analytical mapping of the field's conceptual landscape.

## The Community Engaged Research Faculty Circle

The Community Engaged Research Faculty Circle (CERF-C) is a faculty working group established in 2020 to advance the practice and scholarship of community-engaged research at Indiana University Indianapolis. CERF-C comprises faculty members from diverse disciplines who share a commitment to community engagement and collaborative research.

```{r membership-table}

member_df <- read_csv("contributors.csv", col_names = TRUE, show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  arrange(last, first) |>
  mutate(Name = str_c(first, last, sep = " ")) |>
  select(Name, Unit)

ft <- member_df |>
  flextable() |>
  flextable::theme_vanilla() %>%
  flextable::fontsize(size = 12, part = "all") %>%
  flextable::font(part = "header", fontname = "IBM Plex Sans Condensed") |>
  flextable::bold(part = "header", bold = TRUE) |>
  flextable::align(align = "left", part = "all") %>%
  autofit()

ft

```

## Core Definition

The definition was developed through a two-stage process. In the first stage, members of the Community Engaged Research Faculty Circle drafted and refined candidate language through multiple rounds of discussion. In the second stage, the draft definition was subjected to a Delphi validation process with community stakeholders. This sequence ensured that the statement reflects both disciplinary consensus among faculty and validation from community partners, providing a definition that is conceptually robust and contextually grounded.

## Strategic Implications

Community engaged research stands as a cornerstone of Indiana University Indianapolis's 2030 Strategic Plan and public mission, yet its complex, interdisciplinary nature has traditionally challenged conventional resource allocation approaches. This analytical framework transforms that complexity into strategic clarity, revealing how targeted investments in specific conceptual domains can amplify institutional impact, enhance external funding competitiveness, and strengthen community partnerships that define public university excellence.

The framework identifies distinct patterns across three critical dimensionsâ€”Foundation (conceptual centrality), Integration (structural connectivity), and Leverage (hierarchical influence)â€”that provide strategic guidance for resource allocation and institutional positioning.

### Interpretation Framework

Understanding how concepts score across the three analytical tiers enables targeted investment strategies with measurable institutional returns:

**Foundation Tier** measures conceptual centralityâ€”how fundamental a concept is to practitioners' understanding of CEnR. High-foundational concepts represent the field's core identity and require definitional clarity and values alignment to ensure institutional coherence.

**Integration Tier** measures structural connectivityâ€”how essential a concept is to the field's operational coherence. High-integration concepts serve as critical infrastructure that, when strengthened, enhance the entire CEnR ecosystem's functionality.

**Leverage Tier** measures hierarchical influenceâ€”how much power a concept has to drive systemic change. High-leverage concepts represent strategic intervention points where modest investments yield disproportionate field-wide advancement.

### Strategic Investment Categories

#### System Integrators: The Counterintuitive Priority (Low Foundation + Very High Integration + Very High Leverage)

**Examples**: Impact \& Outcomes, Student Engagement \& Development

**Critical Discovery**: These concepts represent the most counterintuitive but strategically crucial findingâ€”they function as the operational core of CEnR systems while remaining definitionally invisible. **Impact \& Outcomes** emerges as the paramount example, scoring at maximum levels for both Integration and Leverage despite minimal Foundation presence.

**Strategic Priority**: Critical Investigation and Infrastructure Development (25-30% of CEnR resources)

**Institutional Actions**:

- Prioritize comprehensive impact measurement systems as flagship CEnR investment
- Establish dedicated infrastructure for tracking and communicating impacts across academic and community domains
- Investigate why these operationally crucial concepts lack definitional prominence
- Systematize student engagement tracking and learning outcome measurement

**Institutional Payoffs**: Enhanced external funding competitiveness, measurable community benefit documentation for accreditation and reputation, clear demonstration of public university value proposition through documented impact rather than assumed value.

#### Integration Amplifiers: Operational Excellence (Medium Foundation + Very High Integration + Very High Leverage)

**Examples**: Community Organizations, Community Partnerships \& Collaboration, Policy Outcomes

**Strategic Priority**: High Development Investment (15-20% of CEnR resources)

**Institutional Actions**:

- Stabilize funding for community partnership coordination and organizational liaison work
- Embed permanent administrative structures supporting community relationship management
- Systematize policy impact tracking and partnership effectiveness measurement
- Build relationship-building infrastructure and community liaison capacity

**Institutional Payoffs**: Enhanced student recruitment through authentic experiential learning, strengthened community relationships supporting institutional reputation, documented policy influence enhancing legislative and donor relations.

**Critical Interdependency**: These amplifiers require Values Infrastructure for legitimacy and benefit from System Integrator measurement approaches for accountability.

#### Values Infrastructure: Very High Foundation + High Integration

**Values & Principles**, **Governance**, **Faculty**, and **Public Outreach & Communication** provide ethical and operational foundation that legitimizes all other CEnR investments.

- **Codify** clear governance structures and values statements for CEnR oversight
- **Develop** faculty through targeted CEnR methodology and values training
- **Communicate** institutional commitment through strategic outreach highlighting CEnR principles

**Institutional Payoffs:** Enhanced institutional reputation for ethical community engagement, improved faculty satisfaction and retention through values alignment, strengthened community trust supporting long-term partnerships.

**Critical Interdependency:** This infrastructure provides the legitimacy and ethical framework that makes Foundational Infrastructure investments credible and sustainable.

#### Operational Bridges: High Integration + High Leverage

**Research Methodology & Approach** and **Trust & Relationship Building** serve crucial translational functions, connecting foundational values with measurable outcomes.

- **Invest** in methodology training and community relationship-building resources
- **Support** faculty development in CEnR-specific research approaches
- **Create** relationship-building infrastructure and community liaison capacity

**Institutional Payoffs:** Enhanced research quality and community relationship sustainability, improved faculty capacity for competitive grant applications, stronger community partnerships supporting institutional mission.

**Critical Interdependency:** These bridges are essential for scaling the Foundational Infrastructure and translating Values Infrastructure into tangible outcomes.

#### Operational Bridges: Translational Infrastructure (High Foundation + High Integration + High Leverage)

**Examples**: Trust \& Relationship Building, Research Methodology \& Approach
